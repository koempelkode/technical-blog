In this post, we'll explore the intricacies of controlled inputs in React by dissecting the `ControlledInput` component. This component is designed to efficiently intake data from users, such as article submissions, and provides a smooth user experience.

## Introduction:

Controlled inputs are a fundamental concept in React, allowing developers to manage form data with precision and flexibility. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the `ControlledInput` component, understanding its inner workings and leveraging its capabilities to enhance user interactions.

## Understanding the ControlledInput Component:

```javascript
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";

export default function ControlledInput(props) {
    const { value, onChange } = props;

    const handleChange = (event) => {
        const newValue = event.target.value;

        onChange(newValue);
    };

    const textAreaRef = useRef(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        if (textAreaRef.current) {
            textAreaRef.current.style.height = "auto";
            textAreaRef.current.style.height = textAreaRef.current.scrollHeight + "px";
        }
    }, [value]);

    return (
        <textarea 
            className='p-4
            w-96
            active:outline-none 
            focus:outline-none  
            grid-rows-2
            text-gray-900 
            border 
            border-gray-300 
            rounded-lg 
            bg-gray-50 
            sm:text-md 
            focus:ring-blue-500 
            focus:border-blue-500 
            dark:bg-gray-700 
            dark:border-gray-600 
            dark:placeholder-gray-400 
            dark:text-white 
            dark:focus:ring-blue-500 
            dark:focus:border-blue-500'  
            value={value} 
            onChange={handleChange} 
            ref={textAreaRef}>
        </textarea>
    );
}
```

## Exploring Controlled Inputs:

The `ControlledInput` component exemplifies the power of controlled inputs in React. By utilizing the `value` and `onChange` props, we ensure that the component's state remains in sync with user input. Additionally, the use of `useEffect` and `useRef` hooks enables dynamic resizing of the textarea based on its content.
