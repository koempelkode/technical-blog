In this post, we'll create a set of navigation links for a Next.js application using Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Introduction:

Navigation links are crucial for any web application as they provide users with easy access to different sections of the website. In this tutorial, we'll build a simple yet effective set of navigation links using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Creating the Navigation Links Component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Link from "next/link";

export default function NavLinks() {
    return (
        <div className="flex flex-row justify-right items-center gap-10 text-lg">
            <NavLink href={"/"} label={"Home"} />
            <NavLink href={"/archive"} label={"Articles"} />
            <NavLink href={"/login"} label={"Login"} />
        </div>
    );
}

const NavLink = (props) => {
    return (
        <Link href={props.href} className="">
            {props.label}
        </Link>
    );
}
```

This code snippet defines a `NavLinks` component using React. It consists of a flex container with three navigation links (`Home`, `Articles`, and `Login`), each wrapped in a `NavLink` component that utilizes Next.js's `Link` for client-side routing. Feel free to adjust the existing links and/or add your own links - but be sure to maintain the same syntax.

## Conclusion:

In this post, we've created a simple yet effective set of navigation links for a Next.js application using Tailwind CSS. Navigation links are essential for providing users with easy access to different sections of the website, and by using Next.js's `Link` component, we ensure smooth client-side routing.
